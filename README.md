# Force-with-sound
This simple project uses an Arduino connected to a force sensor and a buzzer to demonstrate pressure-sensitive sound control. When pressure on the force sensor increases, the buzzer emits a louder sound , making it a simple yet effective example of analog input controlling analog output.
