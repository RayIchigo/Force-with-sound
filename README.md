# Force Sensor and Buzzer 
This simple project uses an Arduino connected to a force sensor and a buzzer to demonstrate pressure-sensitive sound control. When pressure on the force sensor increases, the buzzer emits a louder sound , making it a simple yet effective example of analog input controlling analog output. 
It’s a beginner-friendly project.

## Components Used  
- Arduino Uno  
- Force Sensor (FSR)   
- Buzzer  
- Breadboard  
- Jumper Wires  

## How It Works  
1. The force sensor detects applied pressure (analog input).  
2. The Arduino reads this analog value and maps it to a PWM signal.  
3. The PWM signal is sent to the buzzer.  
4. The more pressure applied → the louder the buzzer sounds.
